# CraftMineFix

The minecraft april fools update 2025, "25w14craftmine" has a few nitpicky and some progression-halting bugs. This mod aims to make it better.
If you have any more suggestions of things to fix, please leave a comment, or a bug report on this mod's GitHub.
Fixes can be toggled in config/craftminefix.config. fixes that make the game more difficult are off by default

### Current Fixes:
- "DRY LAND" world effect is obtainable.
- Shields now actually function.
- Changed wording from "one heart" to "one HP"
- Minecrafter can no longer be exploded, softlocking the game
- "Wither Skeletons" world effect now uses wither skeleton spawn egg
- Objects in bundles and shulker boxes are properly rewarded when exiting
- Can't hotswap armor before unlocking "Armaments"
- Battles can no longer be cheesed by leaving and returning
